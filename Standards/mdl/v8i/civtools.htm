Updates, information, and inquiries regarding this Bentley Library Utility can be found in the <a href="http://communities.bentley.com/communities/other_communities/bentley_library/default.aspx">Bentley Library and Content community</a> on <a href="http://communities.bentley.com/">Be Communities</a>.

<H2>Description</H2>
Civil/Site Tools (CivTools) is an application designed for Surveying and Civil/Site users.
<p>
<b>NOTE:</b> This utility application includes very basic surveying and civil/site capabilities. The Bentley Road and Site Design Solutions provides much more comprehensive functionality -- <a href="http://www.bentley.com/roads/">click here for more information</a>.

<H2>Installation Instructions</H2>
CivTools.ma and CivTools.DLL should be copied into the same folder (i.e. <code>..\mdlapps\</code>). 

<H2>To load CivTools</H2>
Key in: <code>MDL LOAD CIVTOOLS</code> from the Key-in Browser 
<p>
or 
<p>
from Utilities &gt; MDL Applications &gt; Browse, select CivTools
<p>
The Civil/Site Tools palette displays.

<h2>Place Contour</h2>
<p>Used to place 3D line-string or curve-strings that represent contours. Turn on the Planar option to place contours. If the Planar option is off, you can key in different elevations for each datapoint to allow breaklines to be easily defined. </p>
<h2>Label Contour</h2>
<p>Allows you to label contours individually or in groups. You can label groups by striking a line across all the elements to be labeled. Only contours on major or minor contour levels (as defined in the CivTools parameters) are processed. </p>
<h2>Place Breakline</h2>
<p>Provides the ability to place breaklines as lines or curves at a specific elevation and optionally increment or decrement the elevation of successive vertices. </p>
<h2>Place Coordinate</h2>
<p>Allows you to place a coordinate marker with the respective Northing and Easting coordinates (and optionally the elevation) of an identified point. You can choose the output prefixes and suffixes as well as the order of the NE or EN coordinate output (the latter is in the Coordinates tab of the Civil Tool Properties dialog).</p>
<h2>Modify Contour</h2>
<p>Allows you to modify contour vertices without modifying the vertices' elevation. </p>
<h2>Set Elevation by Crossing</h2>
<p>Modify the elevations of sequential contours (identified by a crossing line) to a user-specified absolute or delta interval. </p>
<h2>Set Element Elevation</h2>
<p>Enables you to set Z value for all vertices of a line-string, curve-string, or complex-string to a specified value. </p>
<h2>Place Spot Elevation</h2>
<p>Enables you to place text and an optional marker to marker elevation. The elevation can either be keyed in, or taken from the datapoint elevation. </p>
<h2>Place Composite Curve</h2>
<p>Provides the ability to place "curves" using straight lines and arcs. </p>
<h2>Civil Tools Settings</h2>
<p>Allows you to set the level, symbology, and size of the all the elements placed using the Civil/Site tools. </p>
<p>By default, CivTools uses what is set in Settings &gt; Design File... &gt; Working Units &gt; Linear Units for coordinate placement. You can override that with the "Use Design File Settings" setting in this dialog. Note that not all coordinate readout values are available when overriding Design File Working Unit Linear Units. </p>
